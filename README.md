# Database of reusable code


## Deprecated - See Code Database CSharp

## this code was one of my first attempts at visual basic, much can be improved upon.  I have moved my efforts away from visual basic and onto CSharp, in the process I have begun to write much more concise code.

As of 5/15/2017 work in progress

Project seeks to provide an easy way for users to store and reference code on a functional basis.  Users are able to upload text files to the application, upload individual functions, and query the database for files or functions.  Users will also be able to add functions to new library files of their choosing.  Library files will be automatically populated with import statements suggested by the functions.
