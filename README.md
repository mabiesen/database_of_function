# Database of reusable code

As of 5/15/2017 work in progress

Project seeks to provide an easy way for users to store and reference code on a functional basis.  Users are able to upload text files to the application, upload individual functions, and query the database for files or functions.  Users will also be able to add functions to new library files of their choosing.  Library files will be automatically populated with import statements suggested by the functions.
